# Buffer-Overflow-Vulnerability
Testing the buffer overflow vulnerability in a test environment

## A Brief Introduction

This is a tutorial developed using a C program just to test the buffer overflow vulnerability and test it on a Ubuntu 18:04 server.

## Pre-requisites

```
ubuntu 18:04 server
gcc (C compiler installed)
gdb (C compiler debugger in order to see compile code and memory address organiation
``` 
## Steps to Execute

First of all clone this git repository inside the Ubuntu server you are using;
```
git clone https://github.com/syedsaadahmed/Buffer-Overflow-Vulnerability.git
```
Secondly we have to compile the C langugae code;
```
gcc -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -no-pie vuln.c -o vuln
```
Segmentation Fault by inserting 550 characters
```
run $(python -c 'print "a" * 550')
```
Creation of patterns for memory addresses 
```
pattern_create 550 pat
run $(cat pat)
```
